Button pulse animation when clicked
Hover effects with transform and shadow transitions
Theme toggle button with rotation animation
Sliding notification animation

JavaScript Functions

Functions to store and retrieve user preferences (theme, colors)
Animation trigger function for button and card animations
Notification system with automatic timeout

Local Storage Implementation

Stores user's dark/light theme preference
Saves custom color choices (primary and secondary colors)
Persistence across page reloads

How to Use It

Theme Switching: Click the moon/sun icon in the top-right to toggle between light and dark themes
Animations: Click the "Animate Me" button to trigger animations on both the button and cards
Custom Colors: Select your preferred colors and click "Save Colors" to customize the UI
Reset Options: Use the reset buttons to clear animations or stored preferences

The project demonstrates proper separation of concerns with CSS handling the visual effects, JavaScript managing the interactive behavior, and localStorage providing data persistence between sessions.
